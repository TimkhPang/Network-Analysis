# Network-Analysis: Local Network Security Assessment & Vulnerability Reporting

This project conducts a comprehensive security assessment of a local network using industry-standard tools like Nmap, Nikto, Zenmap, Wireshark, and Netcat. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, map network topology, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance security posture.

## ðŸŽ¯ Assessment Objectives & Key Findings

| Objective                                  | Methodology & Tools Employed                                      | Outcome / Recommendations                                           |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network Discovery**                      | Utilized `ifconfig` and `nmap` for host and port identification   | Mapped active devices and open ports                                 |
| **Vulnerability Scanning**                 | Deployed `nikto` and `nmap --script vuln`              | Identified outdated services, missing patches, and misconfigurations |
| **Traffic Analysis**                       | Analyzed traffic patterns using `wireshark`                        | Detected unencrypted protocols and potential data leaks              |
| **Service Enumeration**                    | Employed `netcat` for banner grabbing                              | Discovered services with known vulnerabilities                        |
| **Reporting & Documentation**              | Compiled findings into a comprehensive PDF report                  | Provided actionable steps for remediation and hardening               |
